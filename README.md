# flutter_tasks

Tasks and notes application customized for my own needs, made in Flutter. Started as a learning project. Still under construction.

## Next steps

Reformatting the source code, making it more consistent and readable. 
Implementing better State Management logic. 
Redesigning the main menu.
Implementing features: 
  - Categories 
  - Alarm for tasks
  - Customized sounds for clicks, transitions and other interactions. (Sound is present in Settings but is still not implemented)
  - Note sharing in a nice format.
  - Reward and task tracking system
  - Icons for iOS and Android
  - Improving error management
  - Add credits
  - Implement search (it's present in the main menu, but it is not implemented).
  - ..everything else that comes to my mind.
  
### Current features

Currently you can:
  - Add tasks and notes separated in 4 types : Do, Doing, Done and Notes, with header, details, steps and images tabs.
  - Manually change type of your tasks to match the current status or let the app do it automatically. (if you move it manually once, app will no longer move the task automatically (you can turn it off completely in the Settings).
  - Use light or dark mode (needs refomatting, but works fine)
  - Add images to your tasks (unlimited number for all images in a task/note, but only 10 can be added in one session).
  - Add/remove steps for tasks.
  - Recognizing and opening links.
  - Remove tasks/notes.

##### Warning
  
  Project is in early development stages and should not be considered as a valid reference to proper Flutter app development. It needs a lot more tuning, as many things in the project were written while I was pretty novice at Flutter.
